  "This is my first \(minor\) mode.  Suggestions, hints and specially
coding tips most welcome.  Lots of help from Kai appreciated.

This provides l2n-mode, and n2l-mode.

In the former, letters are converted to numbers \(as on phone\) as you
type them.  In the latter, nothing is done as you type \(since each
number can correspond to several letters\).

Pressing TAB cycles through the various choices for the preceding-char.

I seemed to 'need' such a mode when updating my phonebook etc :\)

If the optional argument ASSOC-MAP-P is nol-nil, the map is assumed to

to be of the form (ELT choices).  Then, the preceding char is assoced

is a non-list, choices is assumed to be character and is the

a member of choices, the following member is the replacement, else the
first member of choices is the desired replacement.
